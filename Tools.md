# Tools

Explore the tools and pipelines available for spatial biology research.

## Available Tools
### _in situ_ sequencing  
- [PLP probe design](https://ra427c910.serve.scilifelab.se/) : A portal to design probes for _in situ_ sequencing method.  
- [NicheCompass Nextflow Pipeline](/Units/In_Situ_Sequencing/Codes/Workflows/NicheCompass/README.md): A powerful pipeline for niche analysis.  

### Spatial Proteomics  
- [Signal to noise ratio app](https://snrapp.serve.scilifelab.se/)   
- [is-PLA pipeline](https://github.com/BIIFSweden/6870_isPLA): A pipeline to detect is-PLA signals and intersect with other selected biomarkers.    
- [Extracting biomarkers from images in QuPath](Units/Spatial_Proteomics/Codes/Scripts/Extracting_multichannel_images.groovy) A script for QuPath to export and save each biomarker in an independent file. Check the demonstration in this [video](https://youtu.be/802NyI9pbeA?si=17kpN-bibHgxVvc4).

### Spatial Transcriptomics  
- [nf-core/spatialvi](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/dev/)  
![]('./Images/spatialvi_subway.png')  nf-core pipeline to analys Visium data.
